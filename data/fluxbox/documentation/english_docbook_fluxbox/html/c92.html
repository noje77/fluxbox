>Many distributions provide binary packages of Fluxbox (or,
in the case of Gentoo and FreeBSD, ports/ebuilds) which make
installing Fluxbox pretty painless. There are reasons to compile
from source, however. For example, the most recent version of
Fluxbox might not be available as a distribution package.
Additionally, it might be desirable to compile Fluxbox with a
certain set of compiler flags.  If you would like to use your
distributions packages, consult the distribution docs. For some
distributions, both source and binary packages are provided on the
Fluxbox site.</P
><P
>The purpose of this document is to help people who are
fairly new to the X11 windowing system (or Linux in general) compile
and install the Fluxbox window manager.</P

>The first thing that you will want to do is go to the
<A
HREF="http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net/download.php"
TARGET="_top"
>download
page</A
> and download the source tarball (the extension will be
.tar.gz). </P
><P
>From time to time, special developer releases are made.
Those allow a preview of things to come, new features and the
like. Due to their developer-release quality, they sometimes lack
functionality or stability. Try them if you want bleeding edge
Fluxbox - with all the benefits and dangers. Directions on how to
fetch the can be found in the News section of the official
Fluxbox site.</P

><P
>Okay, now that you have the source tarball, you have to
extract the goods. This can be done by running the following
command, replacing the filename with the one of the file you
downloaded:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>    $ tar xzvf fluxbox-0.1.12.tar.gz</PRE
><P
>It will then throw out a list of the files that are being
un-archived. After you do this, change into the directory that was
created (it will be something like
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>fluxbox-0.1.12/</TT
>, but it depends on the
version). The next step is to configure and make Fluxbox.
During the configure run, you can enable or disable some features
in Fluxbox. For most people, the defaults should be okay. If you
want Fluxbox' slit to work with KDE panel icons, you would add
the option <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>--enable-kde</KBD
>. To find out what
other options are provided by the configure script, use the option
<KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>--help</KBD
>.  If you don't want to enable KDE,
this should suffice:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>    $ ./configure
    $ make</PRE
><P
>After Fluxbox is compiled, become root and run:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>    # make install</PRE
><P
>Congratulations, you now have compiled and installed
Fluxbox.</P

><P
>It's all nice and good if you have it installed, but what
use is it if you can't run it?</P
><P
>There are two generally different ways to start X11 (and thus
Fluxbox). The traditional way is using the command
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>startx</TT
>. The other way is using a graphical
login manager (also called "display manager"). The most common
display manager is <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>xdm</TT
> which is part of the
XFree86 distribution. The display manager provided by Gnome is
called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>gdm</TT
>, the one from KDE is
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>kdm</TT
>.</P
><P
>If X11 is started the former way (via
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>startx</TT
>), the file that is important is called
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.xinitrc</TT
> and resides in your home directory.
In the case of starting via a display manager, the file is
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.xsession</TT
> which resides at the same
location.</P
><P
>The next step is to find the executable for Fluxbox. For
most people, this is <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/bin/fluxbox</TT
>.
Now you need to edit (or create) the file I just mentioned. 
Just put the following line at the bottom of the file:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>   exec /usr/local/bin/fluxbox</PRE
><P
>Change the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/bin/fluxbox</TT
> to
where ever your Fluxbox executable is, the above is the default
location when compiling from source. Once that is done, save it
and close whatever editor you used to edit it. Now you need to run
the following command if you use
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>startx</TT
>:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>   $ chmod 700 .xinitrc</PRE
><P
>In the case of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.xsession</TT
> that is not
needed. In both cases, you should create the directory in which
Fluxbox stores its configuration:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>   $ mkdir .fluxbox</PRE
><P
> If you don't create it, when you exit Fluxbox and restart,
you will lose all your setting.</P
><P
> Maybe copy <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>init</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>menu</TT
>
files from the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/share/fluxbox</TT
> directory 
to the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.fluxbox/</TT
> directory in your home directory.</P
