>General information</H2
><P
>Debugging is a skill which you can learn. There are quite a
few good documents that describe how to make a good bug reports.
Please read them before you get into action, your bug won't run
away and it won't kill you. Rather we want to kill the bug and we
want your help :-) So lets go to battle well prepared. Two nice
documents are the <A
HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Bugzilla
Bug Reporting HOWTO</A
> and Simon Tathams <A

Report Bugs Effectively</A

><P
>Due to the nature of some unofficial patches, we can't
support them all. This means (for you) that you should check if
Fluxbox crashes <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>without</I
></SPAN
> the patches you
applied, too. If the patches of your Fluxbox were applied by some
distribution maintainer, contact him about the issue.</P
><P
>If you require more help with debugging than this guide
provides, you may also see if one of people on #fluxbox at
irc.freenode.net is of help. As the main developers and quite a
bunch of qualified people are usually there, chances are that we
can sort things out.</P

>Output from Fluxbox</H3
><P
>Like any other application Fluxbox sends all messages to the
console it was started from. The problem is that under normal
circumstances all output goes to the <SPAN

><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>text</I
></SPAN
>
console. Change your Fluxbox start line to <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>exec
xterm</KBD
> or whatever your favorite terminal emulator may
be. Start X11 and start Fluxbox in that xterm, and lo and behold,
you can easily see all messages from Fluxbox.</P

>What to do with core
dumps.</H2
><P
>So if you ever get a core dump with Fluxbox do the
following: Go to the channel #fluxbox on OPN and tell fluxgen you
got a core dump. Give him all the info he asks for. He will
probably also ask you to do the following. It's quite a lot of
work but anybody with a bit of common sense and some Unix
experience can do it. Oh, and you need the GNU debugger, called
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>gdb</TT
>.</P

>Rebuild Fluxbox</H3
><P
>Yes you read it right. To become a real debugger you have to
rebuild Fluxbox with debugging symbols.</P
><P
>Build Fluxbox as usual and add the following option when you
do the make:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>    $ CFLAGS=-Wall -g3 CXXFLAGS=-Wall -g3 make</PRE
><P
>If you use the source RPMs from the Fluxbox site or your
distribution you can do something like this:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>    $ su
    # rpm -ivh fluxbox-0.1.11.1mdk.src.rpm
    # cd /usr/src/RPM/SPECS
    # env DEBUG=true rpm -ba fluxbox.spec
    # rpm -Uvh --force /usr/src/RPM/RPMS/i686/fluxbox*
    # exit
    $ mkdir -p ~/src/fluxbox
    $ cp -R /usr/src/RPM/BUILD/fluxbox* ~/src/fluxbox</PRE
><P
>Go to the Fluxbox directory (So we get the core dump in the
right place).  The shell has a nifty feature that disables
core-files so make sure you really get a core file with:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>    $ ulimit -c unlimited</PRE
><P
>Start X11 and let's debug. Do whatever it takes to make
Fluxbox dump core. And now we start debugging:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>    $ gdb fluxbox core</PRE
><P
>And issue this command in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>gdb</TT
> (the first part is
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>gdb</TT
>s prompt, don't type it :)):</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>    (gdb) where</PRE
><P
>Now you get a lot of output. Fluxgen wants to know all the
output that starts with a <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>#</SAMP
>.</P
><P
>Now paste that into an e-mail to fluxgen and also attach the
four settings files in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>~/.fluxbox/</TT
>.</P
><P
>Please do not remove the core and the source code directory
yet. Fluxgen may want to ask you a few extra question and then you
will need them. Please do not send the core file to fluxgen if he
does not ask specifically - since it is specific to your system,
it most probably is of no use to him and core files tend to be
quite big.</P
